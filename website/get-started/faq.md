# FAQ

## What does "Pactus" mean?

“Pactus” is a Latin word and it means “to agree together”, “contract”, “transact”.

## How is Pactus different from Bitcoin?

Pactus is a Proof of Stake blockchain, unlike Bitcoin that is a Proof of Work blockchain.
It means there is mining in pactus. The blockchain is secured by the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.
In Proof of Stake, Validators vote for incoming blocks. These votes are weighted by the Validators' stake.
Once a validator proposes a valid block and the block accepted by other validators, it receives one coin as reward.

## How is Pactus different from Ethereum2?

Ethereum2 is a Proof of Stake Blockchain same as Pactus, however running a validator in Ethereum is not easy.
In Pactus everyone with minimum knowledge of blockchain and minimum hardware joins the network.
Unlike Ethereum there is no minimum stake and you don't need to run the node inside the cloud platform.
You can run the node in any Operating System with minimum hardware.
We truly believe in decentralization.
