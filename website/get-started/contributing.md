<h2>Run a Node</h2>

A 'node' is a software that downloads a copy of the Pactus blockchain and verifies the validity of every block,
then keeps it up-to-date with new blocks and transactions, and helps others download and update their own copies.
Nodes ensure the network keeps running safe and decentralized.
An easy and effective way to help the Pactus network is to run a node.
Running Pactus blockchain is easy. Just [download](https://pactus.org/download/) the latest version of Pactus blockchain and run it.

<h3>Who should run a node?</h3>

Everyone! Nodes are not just for validators. Anyone can run a nodeâ€”you don't even need stake.

Having your own node means you don't need to trust information about the state of the network provided by a third party.

<b>Don't trust. Verify.</b>
